- Make Piece Class (K) Done!
- Change upper and lower docts key with piece classes (Z)
- Make a function which will take the movment list and move the piece class to the next piece (K)
  OR 
  - Makr function which takes initial and next moment tuple to move to and makes that move into the board_dict? 

- A while loop to keep track of the turns 
- Print slides 
 


Main thing will be to understand the functions in util.py and how we can run them? 
As a team I think we divide tasks to get through quicker :) 
For now heres some things I thought of before we have our meeting: 

HOW TO IDENTIFY PAIRS? 
    (a) COULD SORT AND IDENTIFY GOAL PAIRS 
    (b) SORT EACH ONE BY THEIR KEY AND THEN SET GOALS 


DICTIONARY_UPPER = {'P': [(r, q), (r1, q1)]} (n)
DICTIONARY_LOWER = {'R': [(r, q), (r1, q1)]} (m)

NEXT STEPS (FEEL FREE TO ADD MORE)
1. IDENTIFY GOALS OF EACH PIECE 
  (a) What data structure to use? 
  (b) What if a piece has no goal? 
2. ONCE WE HAVE THE PATH FOR THE PIECE IMPLEMENT 
  (a) Implement slide 
  (b) Implement swing
