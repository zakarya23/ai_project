Main thing will be to understand the functions in util.py and how we can run them? 
As a team I think we divide tasks to get through quicker :) 
For now heres some things I thought of before we have our meeting: 

HOW TO IDENTIFY PAIRS? 
    (a) COULD SORT AND IDENTIFY GOAL PAIRS 
    (b) SORT EACH ONE BY THEIR KEY AND THEN SET GOALS 

NEXT STEPS (FEEL FREE TO ADD MORE)
1. IDENTIFY GOALS OF EACH PIECE 
  (a) What data structure to use? 
  (b) What if a piece has no goal? 
2. ONCE WE HAVE THE PATH FOR THE PIECE IMPLEMENT 
  (a) Implement slide 
  (b) Implement swing
